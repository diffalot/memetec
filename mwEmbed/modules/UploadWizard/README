What this is
============

It's the first stab at a more usable multimedia uploader, particularly for Wikimedia Commons.

Main features:
  - Multiple simultaneous file uploads
  - Batch assertion of license ("all these files were CC-BY-SA")
  - "Incomplete" uploads, where the data can be uploaded and metadata edited without really adding the file to the collection.
  - (Eventually) Gee-whiz technology like HTML5 drag & drop from the desktop

General disclaimer
===================

For the moment, (March 2010) UploadWizard is all alpha quality code. 
It often does not conform to the MediaWiki coding standards. This will have to be fixed before it gets merged into trunk. 

It uses MwEmbed because it was found to be very difficult to separate it from the framework.
Furthermore, it is somewhat redundant with the AddMedia module. AddMedia has a lot of useful code but
not factored in the way that would be most convenient for this module.  Michael Dale (mdale) and myself (NeilK) 
are attempting to refactor things and meet in the middle.

Presently (March 2010) we are sprinting to get a hacky interface up to conduct a usability test on our
basic ideas about updating media uploads for commons. Nothing here is expected to stay here permanently.

Stay tuned, or, talk to NeilK about this, if anything here bothers you.


How to use it
=============

This is *very* complicated at present. Obviously we want to make this simpler in the future.

Currently mdale tests with the live Commons site by loading in code from a JS2-enabled prototype.
This is accomplished with a gadget on Commons (or other additions to the skin).

Here's how you might do such a thing:

- Set up an instance of MediaWiki from trunk; or, if feeling brave[1], use a real site like Commons itself.
- Set up an instance of MediaWiki from js-work branch, which your browser can access.
- On this trunk-based Mediawiki, install a gadget which is invoked on all pages to load some code from the JS2-enabled site. Since
  this is all accomplished in your browser, you could use a local hostname. (See below).
- Point your browser to the upload page on the trunk-based mediawiki, with a special parameter: Special:Upload?uploadWizard=1 .


[1] Currently I (NeilK) use a local MediaWiki, since we are uploading stuff *without* the normal checks 
    that the Commons people have carefully added.

[2] The gadget might look like this:

// Once mwEmbed is "on" we can use mw.setConfig calls:
if( typeof mwAddMediaConfig == 'undefined'){
mwAddMediaConfig = {};
}
mwAddMediaConfig['enabled_providers'] = [ 'wiki_commons', 'upload' ]

importScriptURI('http://js2-work.yoursite.local/js/mwEmbed/remotes/mediaWiki.js?&uselang=en&debug=true' );
